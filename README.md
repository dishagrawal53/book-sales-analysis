# INTRODUCTION
Tech Stack: PySpark, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Spark DataFrame, Jupyter Notebook
The Book Sales and Bestseller Analysis project aims to uncover meaningful insights 
from a dataset containing detailed information about 130,000 Kindle e-books. The system is 
designed as a complete data analytics pipeline encompassing data collection, 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, analytical modeling, and visualization. Using 
PySpark for large-scale data handling and matplotlib for graphical representation, the 
project efficiently processes and analyzes the dataset to reveal trends in pricing, 
customer ratings, category performance, and bestseller characteristics. Exploratory 
analysis identifies key patterns, such as the typical price range for bestsellers and 
highly-rated books, while visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of these 
relationships. 

# METHODOLOGY
The system for Book Sales and Bestseller Analysis is designed as a data analytics 
pipeline that consists of the following main stages: 
1) Data Collection: The dataset containing Kindle book information, including 
features like title, price, customer ratings, book category, and bestseller status. This 
data is ingested into the system using PySpark's SparkSession, which allows for 
efficient handling of large volumes of data, making it suitable for analysis at scale. 
2) Data Preprocessing: In this phase, the raw data is cleaned to ensure consistency 
and quality. Missing values are handled by filling or removing rows with 
incomplete information. This ensures that all data is formatted properly and can be
used effectively in the analysis stage.  
4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): During this stage, various statistical methods 
and visualization techniques are applied to gain an understanding of the dataset.
Additionally trends related to bestselling books are explored by filtering for books marked as
bestsellers and analyzing their price and rating patterns. Category-wise performance
is also evaluated by calculating the average, minimum, and maximum book prices, as well 
as the average ratings for each book category. 
6) Analytical Modeling: Key relationships, such as the connection between book 
price and customer ratings, are explored. 
7) Visualization and Insights Generation: Graphs and charts are used to visualize findings clearly.
